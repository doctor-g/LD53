# Mr. Delivery Man

A silly little game created for [Ludum Dare 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53)
based on the theme _Delivery_.
See [this game's Ludum Dare page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/mr-delivery-man) for
more information and discussion.


## Playing the Game

[You can play the Web build on itch.io](https://doctor-g.itch.io/mr-delivery-man)

The Web export for Godot 4 [relies on technology](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html) that is not universally supported. Native builds for Windows and Linux can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/doctor-g/LD53/releases).

Note that if you have a keyboard, you can use Enter and Space as shortcuts during gameplay
instead of using the on-screen buttons.
